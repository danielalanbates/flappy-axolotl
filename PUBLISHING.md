## Publishing to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `flappy-axolotl`
   - **Description**: "A charming underwater Flappy Bird game featuring a realistic pink axolotl"
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if preferred)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Link Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
cd "/Users/daniel/Documents/aicode/Flappy Axolotl"

# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flappy-axolotl.git

# Rename branch to main (optional but recommended)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait a few minutes for deployment
7. Your game will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/flappy-axolotl/`

### 4. Add Repository Topics (Optional)

Add topics to help people find your game:
- `game`
- `javascript`
- `html5-canvas`
- `flappy-bird`
- `axolotl`
- `pwa`
- `browser-game`

### 5. Update README with Live Demo Link

After GitHub Pages is deployed, add this to the top of your README:

```markdown
## ðŸŽ® [Play Now!](https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/flappy-axolotl/)
```

Commit and push the change:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add live demo link to README"
git push
```

## Post-Publishing

### Share Your Game
- Share the GitHub Pages URL on social media
- Post on game development forums
- Submit to browser game directories

### Future Updates
When making changes:

```bash
# Make your changes to the code
git add -A
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

GitHub Pages will automatically update within a few minutes.

## Troubleshooting

### Game doesn't work on GitHub Pages
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify all file paths are relative, not absolute
- Make sure service worker cache names are unique

### High scores don't persist
- This is expected - localStorage is domain-specific
- Each player will have their own local high scores

### PWA doesn't install
- PWA requires HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this)
- Try force refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
- Check manifest.json paths are correct

Good luck with your game! ðŸ¦ŽðŸ’•
