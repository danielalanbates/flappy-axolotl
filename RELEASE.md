# Release Guide - Making Flappy Axolotl Available for Download

This guide will help you publish Flappy Axolotl so anyone can download and play it on any OS without technical knowledge.

## üéØ Goal

Make the game available in two ways:
1. **Web Version** - Play instantly in browser (GitHub Pages)
2. **Desktop Apps** - Download and run on Windows, Mac, or Linux

## üìã Step-by-Step Release Process

### Step 1: Publish to GitHub

```bash
cd "/Users/daniel/Documents/aicode/Flappy Axolotl"

# Create repository on GitHub first (at github.com)
# Then link it:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flappy-axolotl.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages (Web Version)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** in left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. Game will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/flappy-axolotl/`

### Step 3: Build Desktop Apps

On your Mac, run:

```bash
cd "/Users/daniel/Documents/aicode/Flappy Axolotl"

# Build for all platforms
npm run build

# - Flappy Axolotl-1.0.0.AppImage (Linux universal)
